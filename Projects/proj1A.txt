I have no prior coding experience in the language C. I do, however, know some of the benefits 
C has when compared to other languages. One such benefit being C is faster than Python in
completing tasks. I also know that C is a compiled language, while Python is an interpreted
language. Declaring the type of variables and using only values of those particular types is
required in C programs. We can then compile the program into machine code, which makes it
much more efficient for the computer.

I hope to develop a comprehensive understanding of C and strengthen my knowledge of the
Unix/Linux operating systems and virtual machines. I have been interested in learning how to
use virtual machines in the past, so I see this as a great opportunity to learn how to use them
properly in development or testing. I'm also interested in the pros and cons that Linux has in
comparison to systems like MacOS and Windows.

The large amount of content and information that we will cover in the course is the most
frightening part. The previous CS courses have been fairly challenging, however CS 212 seems
to be a step up from the previous courses. That being said, I am still very much looking forward 
to learning the content offered and I believe there are enough resources offered for me to do
well in the class.

I would like to gain a well-rounded understanding of program development, the Unix/Linux
operating systems, and how to use virtual machines properly. If I have a firm knowledge of those
constructs, I can land an internship and be successful. I would also like to become proficient in 
programming my own ideas for tools or applications, since it is a sort of hobby for me.
